# ChessAI_CodeSample

A Chess AI based on the NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
Uses move ordering, PV-List, and a modifierd version killer/history heuristic to improve the performance of pruning.

The ClassicBoardPlayer uses [PeSTo](https://www.chessprogramming.org/PeSTO%27s_Evaluation_Function)'s tapered evaluation function and piece-square tables.

Note:
The Chess AI is based on a chess program that [Michael Lapshin](https://github.com/MichaelLapshin) and I wrote for a Waterloo CS247 project.
As a result, signicant portion of the code cannot be made public, but is available upon request.
The code contained here was not submitted as part of the project and would not count for marks.
